###"From The Ground"###

[Danny Brown:]
8 balls wit a safety pin
I deserve the finer things
Told myself back then
When I used to ride a Schwinn
Now I'm on a tour bus
Going places I ain't never been
Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag
That was way back
Having dreams of a Cadillac
Dog, I had to bounce back
Locked a nigga up
Why they do me like that?
Now I'm on the Jack in the county
Asking mommy for some money
Swear to God she'd do anything for me
Now we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back
So I won't go to sleep 'til I finish that
Cousin of death anyway
Now I see better day
And I ain't tryna miss a minute, second hour
Living on borrowed time
Can't think about tomorrow
'cause it's about today
And you know you wanna take my place
Let's get it

[Kelela:]
You turn around, and now I'm winning
I built it up, from the ground
You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it
I built it up, from the ground

[Danny Brown:]
Now tell me, would you sacrifice your dreams?
What it takes if you want anything
Got me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat
So while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep
No cheat sheet, get it out the mud
Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field
My nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes
It's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die
So no try to do, what about you?
Work off, well met, do the same thing too
A lot locked up wishing they was like you
Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June
Been down for a minute and every since sentence
Things ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga
Staring at the ceiling thinking how far I came
Was trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain

[Kelela:]
You turn around, and now I'm winning
I built it up, from the ground
You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it
I built it up, from the ground

###"Drinks On Me"###

###"Bag Back"###

I lived my whole life for a green piece of paper
Results of chasin' that
Raiders on respirators
Wanna make a deal?
Gotta talk to ya later
They say I'm immature like babies in incubators
Motherfuckers I'm a don
Hood phenomenon
Game so tight I can serve Farrakhan
A bacon double cheese burger, nigga that's unheard of
Koch that, pop that, you never heard of cause
I'm all about murder
Bloody bloody murder
Pound flipper, bitch getter, four clip inserter
Chase the thunder bread like Urkel did Laura
You get in my way and an oceano snorkel

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"

I'm in the hood all day
Where the fuck are you niggas?
Glennwood stove
A loosie and two swishers
And what you don't know
I'm about to teach ya
For them Ben Franklin's niggas singin' like Aretha
Smokin' sour diesel with this bitch named Keyshia
So much lip gloss she fuckin' up the swisher
I'm a real nigga
And nigga you ain't
You a bitch ass nigga, nigga I ain't
Unforgivable
Nigga you bit the fo'
Give it to a nigga now he bleedin' like menstrual
Cycle, you might grow, shoot like Ivo
Monster and the letter man, Thriller like Michael

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"

###"Dope Fiend Rental"###

Trail of blood on that baggie
I done scraped myself with that razor
Gettin head in that trick house and I snuck out without payin her
Locked up in that precinct used my Timberland for a pillow
Break the dank in that swizzle ridin round in a dope fiend rental
Pulling up on ya baby mama like bitch what you tryna get into
If you ain't about that suckin, then ho you can keep on trucking
I'm gettin mine straight up no middle man nigga I don't like you
Fool's Gold the clique and musically we don't fuck with you
Went from holdin crack in my ass crack
To racks on racks on ASCAP
Coulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped
Jadakiss already said that
Do it for the days when for dinner
All a nigga had to eat was a couple of coneys
Broke as fuck and no bitch to fuck
In my basement jackin' off lonely
Used to fall off fuckin' with the work
But guess what? I'm back on ho
No more [?] on that couch
Now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth
And I gag her till she cry
On her stomach fluid come up
I be fuckin' her face on the daily
You be kissin' that bitch in the mouth

[Hook]
Like open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!

[ScHoolboy Q]
If I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air
Then land on my dick from the back
Look I ain't trippin, no, I ain't kiddin'
Have her lickin' my head like a cat
Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah bitch this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have her lyin' in it
How her mouth can be wide as her legs
My dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge
Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe said she need a fix
Gave you life, can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite
Made a crash up at the turnpike
But it's a rental I'll get another
Wonder if you got the gift from your mother
I used to play hoops with your brother
Even played a lil house with your sister
She always call me daddy or mister mister
Why the [?] shirts can do more than fist her
Bitch gettin' head, I ain't never kissed her
B I G never missed a beat
I was [?] so I skeet skeet
Ho can make an orgasm last a week
I'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece
Hell no I don't love that bitch
Hell yeah I'm gon' enjoy that bitch
But I hope my daughter don't be like this
But I know her mama know that shit exist

[Hook]

###"Grown Up"###

[Verse 1:]
Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up

[Hook:]
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[Verse 2:]
I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Niggas catch a heart attack, Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[Hook]

###"XXX"###

30!
Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AK's with bayonets on deck
Rep my set
Sorta like Squidwird and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth
But she just fantasizing
Staring at my skinnys siad it's so tantalizing
Dog I'm strategizing plotting on throne
The masta of the ace sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired
Imaging the equalizer goin from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
Sorta like Neo with them Matrix codes
I try to escape it hoping drugs a numb a soul
Say I'm getting old and times running out
Repeating instrumentals tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving the kicks and snares dodging hooks
Tryna keep it original something that's overlooked
Way a nigga goin might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up calling home for money on my books
Cause if this shit don't work nigga I failed at life
Turning to these drugs now these drugs turned my life
It's the downward spiral, Got me suicidal
But too scared to do it so these pills a be the rival
Surpassing all my idols
Took the wrong turn
But can't go back now so now let that blunt burn
Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
Took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
I took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
Triple X

###"Change Up"###

They thought I was gone, back from the grave
Mind of a master, blood of a slave
Heart of a king, stuck in between
The devil and the angel on my shoulder when I speak
Lost in the streets, found on the beat
Still kept a clip, asked and got it for cheap
Now I'm in a world where they pray for the weak
Stand up niggas, take shots to the knees

Lord have mercy, pray for me
Need to calm down so pass me the weed
Got me stressed out, situations look bleak
Time's running out, how my days turn to weeks?
Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

I'ma keep going, you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up

I'ma keep going, you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never

Every other day, always some shit
I'm the underdog but I'm never over it
Gotta keep a grip when the rent due
Niggas tryna get you for every last cent
Ain't no pretend, ain't tryna make ammends
Just tryna keep my legacy on legend in the end
So never try to sin, 'cause you could get bent
'Cause I protect from beginning to the end

Lord have mercy, pray for me
Distanced from my friends, enemies close to me
Gotta stay alert, things change in a blink
Gotta stay woke, they all in a deep sleep
Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in a drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

###"Monopoly"###

The hybrid smoking on papaya
That give you niggas bronchitis
What you write is vagina
What I write is Wall of China
Nigga that's great
Like 8ths of grape ape Stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on yo mixtape
Naw literally shit all on yo mixtape
Wipe with the credits leave stains on the jewel case
In just two takes then the booth is soufle'd
Your hiding something like toupee
Truthfully my friend touche
You gone get exposed like and up and coming model
And to me your label seems like one of them pagent mommas
So guess who's the lil bitch? That's you
You must suck alot of dick that's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like bristol heart on igloos
My nigga you ain't been what I been through
And if so you'd take a pencil to yo temple
Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even have pads stuffed they panties it tissue
And still hit the ave cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And yo style is like fried chicken without seasoning
Nigga that's bland fuck you and ya mans
Smack you like bitch nigga, that's openhand
Fuck you and yo tough talk
When I monopolize I'm a throw yo ass off the boardwark
Fag don't play sports but he stay at the ball park
Type of nigga u see rocking Crocs at the fucking walmart
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in a fiend car
Get flicked guess what? I'm running from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got a hammer
But Kush got me high like Pac's bandanna
I'm a smart nigga that do dumb shit
In ya babymomma crib not flushing after I piss
I'm Ferris Bueller with Frank Muellers
You blank shooters on stank hooters
I'm in aruba sippin wine coolers
Mind ruler flow sort of like hypnotism
That's why all these white bitches wanna get with em
I smack me up flip em like Mik Bivens
And to me your flows like Ronny Devoe's
My hoes got pretty toes in expensive high heels
And your hoes toes is fucked in beauty supply sandals
I'm a vandal handling any situation
I smoke blunts to the face to stay motivated
Irratated when I'm not sedated
I fuck her face like I was obligated
And still fucking with them freak hoes
Stank pussy smelling like Cooler Ranch Doritoes

###"Dance In The Water"###

###"Dubstep"###

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
I was thinkin' 'bout somethin'
But I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Remember when I was strugglin'
Fucked up on my knuckles
Tryin' to sell some dirt weed
Taxin' off a ten speed
Money wasn't comin'
For sure nigga I kept frontin'

[Hook:]
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
And I kept lickin' on that clit
Till she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long
Swear to God I got a dib
I put my back into it
Servin' bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire
On that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryin' to get my mind
Go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rollin' up that swisher
Pourin' up a four
Servin' in them hallways
The courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down
Now we in the conay

[Hook:]
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
It's the same old shit
Everybody in a manner that's up top
Buck stop,
It's killin' me,
Niggas are makin' really me,
'Cause I never can bottle up and they be filling it with the mideast
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm bangin' it out
Don't be let my money getting opposite and can do time
Listen up Danny Brown
I been doing this ting
Skipped in, then I come and lyrical assist 'em
WOO
I had my dubs on the step
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth, I'm finna choose
But I'm runnin this actually I'm realer than Scrooge
You ain't so why you act, dummy
You think you bad, well that's funny
I'm try'na get Maybach money
I'm a Mac Miller, stayin ASAP, rookie

I had them dubs on the step

###"Torture"###

[Verse 1:]
Remember one time, dawg
This fiend owed the boss
Put Peanut Butter on her pussy
Let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at a payphone.
Got rocked in his dome
Momma picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off
So my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lotta things
Mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on tv
I snapped outta that
Unc beating on my auntie.
Gunshots outside
Was sorta like fireworks
We know they gained fireworks
It's december 21'st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater
On the couch so cold, can't take off your sneakers

[Hook:]
And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrorss
All the shit that I've seen

[Verse 2:]
I feel like a prisoner of war
Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb
Probably need a shrink
Can't get a wink
So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep
Close my eyes, look up, fiend said 1 for 8
Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket served him nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at 'pose be writin' verses
Heard a knock at the do'
'Nother fiend wanted fo'
Gave him what he came for
Told him go to the sto'
Lemme get a box a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola
Gave his ass another stone now guess what it's over
He ain't come back
Before I could look back
I heard the wood on the door crack
And they yelling police
With this work up in my jeans man this a bad dream

[Hook]

###"EWNESW"###

[Verse 1]
I was born one day before Saint Pat
I guess a nigga miss luck just like that
Henry Ford, not even one mile from Motown
Explains all the soul that you hear in my sound
A ten minute ride to Linwood, I begun
My mama first son, look what I just become
A weedhead with words more potent than what I'm smoking
This ain't no Reggie caught the plane ride from Oakland
I used to play with pistols in crackhouses
Skiping school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses
Find one with the lights on it
Landlord came pulled the hook and locks on it
Money I'm plotting on it I put the block on it
I'm gonna get it, four deep, no shocks on it
We sit low, rep the D cause it's all I know
And my name rings bells in any hood you go

[Hook]
You're from the East Side
You're from the West Side
You're from the North End
Are you from South West

[Verse 2]
Around first grade, we move to the East Side
Was like throwing rocks at a beehive
A lot of niggas gone over something unimportant
That it ain't worth mentioning cause it's unfortunate
Like stick a fork in it, where's the enforcement?
Walking off the grass just to sit on niggas porches
Passing round 40's, brown paper bags
Rolling up a swisher while this rat freak a black
It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something
Ate a lunchable for dinner, nigga I'm ain't fronting
Caught the bus to East land, just to walk around it
Ain't buy nothing nigga, just walked around it
Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler
Cause I'm broke as fuck and they is all about a dollar
I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed
Belly of the beast, we don't care about tomorrow
I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed
Belly of the beast, we don't care about tomorrow

[Hook]

###"Theme Song"###

You can act stupid if you want to
Never play by the rules, do just what I want to
Came up in this bitch strong, got without a strong front tooth
Now who they say is number one influence? So, he number two
Yeah, he dance good, but guess where he got the moves?
But compared to me, look like he wear two left shoes
Boy, I treat them little virgins like the restroom
Take my hand and dance with the Devil
Oh, boy, you in trouble, rattled the lion cage
Told God spray ya down while you're prayin' on stage
Jit at your burial, smoke squares at your grave
Then repent for my sins like, "God I'm saved"
He always forgive, later on, I forget
I had my fingers crossed so I'm back on that shit
Catch another body 'fore the song get mixed
The bullets is the lyrics, turn the rapper to a spirit
Singin' with the angels, nigga long gone
This song's like Bishop Ali Wong with a thong on
Nigga, I'm the wrong one to run on
My balls on her Kit-kat, now she playin' ping-pong

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger

Listen here, little Richard, I don't know what got into you
Did mo' for the game than you
That's why I had to cut into ya, you need to be checked
Lil niggas need to learn some respect
When your show's like The Rockettes with some majorettes
Give me a mic and the DJ and I'm set
'Cause these bars on deck, ain't gotta shake my ass
You the real definition of ants in yo' pants
Gotta son, lil niggas, no child support
Sorta like the Bad Boys up against Jordan
But nigga, you ain't scorin', not on me
Wrote this one on one knee, RIP the P
Taught me to keep it real, stand on my own
If I got to, rock a nigga brain with his nose blown
No time for the gimmicks and
I ain't gotta lie when I say I'm independent

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger

###"Fresh Off The Boat"###

Fresh off the boat
You can tell the way I wear my clothes
That I'm fresher than a scent from a rock
Fresh off the boat
You can tell the way I wear my gold
That I shine anywhere around the globe
Fresh off the boat
Getting mine everywhere I go
So if you don't know homie now you know
Fresh off the boat
And homie I demand my respect
Everywhere I go I rep my set
I'm fresh off the boat

[Outro x2:]
Homie, you don't know where I come from
But I know where I'ma go
Fresh off the boat

###"Smokin & Drinkin"###

[Intro:]
Check
A-Trak, what up?

[Verse 1:]
Drop a deuce in that soda
Tell your ho to come over
Coming straight out that Motor
Sipping oil never sober
Bring backwoods of that OG, we smoking them back-to-back
Molly looking like sugar, so you know that I'm dipping it
See my jeans by the stack, and my shoes cost 'bout half of that
Let's not talk 'bout the shirt
She can't even pronounce that
Ghetto nigga on high end
My theory is low end
My tribe on a quest, put that money in motion
So bitch, we smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke
My ho got tats on her face
Sell me them cookies from Oakland
But not the kind that you eat, stuff it in Swisher Sweets
And we smoke blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt

[Bridge:]
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Spaced-out, rolling up that stinky
Big big blunts the size of pinkies
Pour one out, we still be leaning
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Smoking, drinking, drinking, smoking
In that order, we slow motion
'Til it's over, never stop

[Hook:]
Smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke [x3]

[Verse 2:]
Gotta get away, to escape, I smoke this kush to the face
Gotta get away, get away, I think I need the brain
Please oh Lord, oh Lord, I need your help again
Took too many pills, and I think I hear my heart beating
Taking over those chances, honey backwoods stuffed with that grammy
My ho blowing on that potter, mixing liquor with them xannies
Stress party, get away, hope that these problems just go away
Right there in my face, I ignore it every day

###"Pneumonia"###

Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia

Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia

Old nigga came in this bitch with a new gun
Clip looking like a fucking mile long
If that shit hits you close range, ya calzone
Powder stains on my Balmain
Slurp that pussy up just like lo mein
If that coke burn my nose, I'ma complain

Made 30 bands in 30 minutes

Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia

Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia

I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
Got a half a pound of artichoke
Scale broke, so we eyeball it
Her titties out just like New Orleans
Mardi gras, we party hard, she off the soft
My dick head, she celebrate like the world end
And she could be my girlfriend
Only fuck her on the weekend
Momma found some racks in some dirty jeans
Told her keep the money, take 'em to the cleaners
Threesome watched how this dick came between them
Licked the clit and she did the Macarena
Crib in the forest, deer in my yard
'07, I got locked up on a charge
Now a nigga got four bank cards
Looking like a nigga gotta thank God
Going through a bag like I'm snatching purses
Half a key of raw inside my fucking verses
Like a surgeon with that scalpel, bring that track to life
Bounce that ass for that pussy, got a appetite
Geeked up, geeked up, pop a pill just like Mike and Ikes
Head sent me straight to the moon with a mac tonight
Running low on alcohol, nigga gotta make a call
Stay afloat, try not to choke

Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya
Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya

I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
Got a half a pound of artichoke
Scale broke, so we eyeball it
Her titties out just like New Orleans

###"Detroit State Of Mind Pt. 2"###

[Verse 1]
Roaches crawlin' up the wall, piss-stained beds
Niggas dreamin' 'bout piff, but we rolling up reg
Still scream, though his momma say, "never leave the backyard"
Niggas out shooting, used condoms on the playground
Stay 'round crackheads, squatting out vacant flats
Teen girls getting raped, man it's all fact
Hooks swoop up, take your money and your crack
Might get your weed back, put your ass out the back
Starvin', narcs comin' we chalking
Run up, stash the work, get the guns out the closet
Seen niggas in the county get they brains stomped out
While the dep's did nothing they just stood there and watched
Tired of Coney, motor city got me lonely
For security, I got the .40 on me
Crib's rent unpaid, bills in the mailbox
Letter from your cousin on the bloc, man it stay hot
Most niggas I grew up with that are locked up
Are lost to a trap, leader ass stuck
And most souls I know got babies or a lady
Never met a old chick that tell me that she married
It's crazy in a city where there's money to gamble
But lookin' at the scenery, it's all in shambles
I lay back, reminisce on earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

[Hook 2x]
When the moon come out, and the sun don't shine
I be on the corner all day continuing the grind
When the sun comes up that just let me know the time
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

[Verse 2]
At the Cabernet, late night, saturday
Tight fitted, drunk off hennessey, I put the gat away
I'm nervous 'bout it cause these niggas lookin' kinda strange
As I have them very thoughts, niggas got it in the brain
I'm headed for the exit, while I'm slipping on champagne
Kicking bottles on the floor, I'm just trying to hit the door
And everybody else too ain't tryna get trampled
Heard two shots, tripped, and twisted my ankle
And we can never party, a bunch of hatin' niggas
In a city that's corrupted with some grimey-ass bitches
Could be your best friend or even your relative
Snitch on you or put the .40 in your grill
And nigga that ain't right, niggas your whole life
When you get locked won't send you a kite
I lay back, reflect, think of earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

[Hook 2x]

###"Scrap Or Die"###

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
We been lookin at the house for a bout a whole
A family live there got put out last month
My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt
His homey in the basment smoking crack with his aunt
And tonights that night we bout to get right
Piled up in a van with a couple flashlights
This metal crowbars gonna get us through the door
We come to take everything fuck the landlord
So now we at the place skullys on bareface
Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place
My unc took outside he ripping down the gutters
So we inside tearing up this motherfucker
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and left over appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
Cause the furnace so big it wouldn't fit in the back

[Hook:]
Now it's copper bout by the pound
Wire by the inch
Got a check on the first
And it's gone by the 5th
Scrap or Die Nigga
And you might be laughing at it cause you know the shit is true
Rusty flat bed truck the color as doo-dooo
Scrap or Die Nigga

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Early morning next day at the junkyard
Got four loads bout to get broke off
But these niggas slick I sweat I'm going off
Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off
Cause I know we had way more than at
Fuck it, split it up ay I get more than at
These niggas always slick on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
Now we back in the hood plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic
And we gone go over there and see what's up with it
Now we up in it taking old computers
Until we fucking heard "Don't move or I shoot ya."
Fucked up hook caught us tryna cash in
Now we gotta B&E case and trespassing

[Hook]

###"Float On"###

[Verse 1:]
Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep see I be going through things
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
About how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat stuck on every line
Nothing else matters except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit
Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on
Nigga I float on

[Hook x4: Charli XCX]
I float on
Let's go
Hop up in the Chevy 4 door let's roll

[Verse 2:]
Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink unless I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shits throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music
And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on
Nigga I float on

[Hook x4: Charli XCX]

###"Guitar Solo"###

My little nigga fourteen...
Got his hand on the forty with the infrared beam
His daddy locked up and his mama is a fiend
Catch her trickin' on the corner, knees dirty on her jeans
At night he never dreams cause he hardly ever sleep
Layin' in the bed facin' someone else's feet
So late night he creep, walk around these streets
With the same hoodie on, he been wearin' for a week
He wants something to eat, and his sneaks so scuffed
Just lookin' in his eyes, you can tell he livin' rough
Standing outside a gas station puffin' on a loosie
Dropped outta school cause his peers appeared bougie
And they wear gucci, and shit that rappers talk
Robbed an old lady but his ass got caught
Will he get out, man I really don't know bro
I hope I'll find out after the guitar solo

After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...
After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...

This little girl pregnant man she only fourteen
Bust in by an older nigga, lack of self-esteem
Her mom's a gold-digger, and her dad is not around
Last time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle
A child with a child and her mama don't care
Another bridge card gon' put her on welfare
Baby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed
Cause he bought a pair of cardi's 'stead of reing-up the weed
His dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch
Is that the type of man you want raising your kids?
So now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger
And every other day yo' mama fuck another nigga
So what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer
Her dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga
And will she get far? I really don't know bro
I hope I find out after the guitar solo

The guitar solo...
After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...
Guitar solo...

###"Clean Up"###

[Verse 1:]
The thoughts all cloudy in the marijuana sky
But it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name
But I'm feeling on my breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week done went past, I don't go no where
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying "Daddy I miss you"
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple g's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

[Hook: x2]
It's time for me to clean it up
I came to far to fuck it up like...

[Verse 2:]
Pops left mom when I was only 18
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28 mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31 she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up,
Mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some g's, but that makes it no better
Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

[Hook]

###"Rolling Stone"###

[Hook: Petite Noir]
You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just release me

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Feeling like I got money
No, I'm just nigga rich
Even if she fuck me
I still know life a bitch
Bought a nightmare, sold a dream
Happiness went upstream
Blame myself, I had no control
Now I'm living with no soul
I'm on a roll that never ends
Don't know opposite of sin
Some people say I think too much
I don't think they think enough
Time rough and it got rougher
Weird having you up on my shoulder
Living crooked 'til it's over
Can't be straight, can't be sober
Thought process so immature
Can't make it up out the sewer
Feeling like there's no hope
Blazed out my mind flow
I love her, she love me
Love ended up with no bites
Fucked up, that's the way it is
I don't know who I should trust
Riding around with the windows up
Smoking like it's ten of us
Just me in the back seat
With the driver bumping on my sleeves
I'm walking on this long road
Will I come back?
Homie, I don't even really know

[Hook: Petite Noir]
You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just release me

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Feeling like I'm not alive
But I know I'm not dead
Living lies but can't hide
Deep inside, the truth dies
But hope can't get change
Lost my brain, going insane
Self-medicate is how I cope
Leave my body so go afloat
On a roll that never ends
Don't know where I should begin
Feeling trapped, no looking back
Headfirst in that deep end
Living like a rolling stone
When I die, I leave alone
Getting high, I feel low
But we all know life goes on

[Hook: Petite Noir]
You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just re-

[Outro: Petite Noir]
All that I know
All that I know is to feel your shame
'Cause you can't let go
'Cause you can't let go, you drive me insane
But will I ever find my way?
Or go back to the beginning
There's a thing that I know for sure

###"Molly Ringwald"###

###"Gremlins"###

I know some lil' niggas that thirst cream
That pop a bitch on camera and we ain't talkin' bout twerk team
Shootin' up cribs turnin' porches to smokescreens
Mama smoking nightmares chasin' her pipe dream
Hard to give advice behind the mind of the call
So his limits have ceilings cause his pop behind walls
School become a free meal
Tree become a cheap thrill
Same prices pa paid he gon' pay a cheap deal
Hourglasss empty but he lookin' for a refill
Revolver breakdancin, yeah he make that bitch windmill
Guess he's just a psycho in the city in the Chrysler
Everybody livin' spiteful nigga lookin' just to ice you
So we livin' hostile just to cop some Aeropostale
Trenchcoat Mafia, for a lil' Hollister
Gotta get his dollas up
So we hit the dice game
Lost all his re-up, now he rob the dice game
Probation violation call his ass the son of Satan
Got these old niggas scared like it's crystal lake and Jason
Cause they been through cases they ain't tryna go back
Fresh meat up on the street he give a fuck about that
Snatchin' Carti's downtown wear 'em same damn week
Tryna get the same bitches on the same damn street
Rob a ho ass nigga at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
Cause they gremlins

Gremlin

He just wanna smoke some kush
And fuck with some hoes at the mall
For that shit, he wished it all
Baby face and all, my lil' nigga gotta ball, lil' nigga gotta ball
Run up on you where that money at
Fuck nigga after that
Lean in that double cup
Lil nigga screwed up
Pop a pill nigga
And he don' feel nigga
You do it in the song, he do it for real nigga
And all his OGs is either dead or in prison
Scared to talk to him like, fuck it they won't listen
Unnecessary shit, thinkin' that he has to
A pair of True Religions dog, my lil nigga blast you
Listenin' to 2 Chainz, ain't thinkin' bout college
I wonder if he knew that 2 Chainz went to college
I wonder if he knew that, would that change his mind?
Guess that's somethin' we'll find in due time

###"Counterfeit"###

I'm feelin' kinda sick
Shorty cause my last flip got hit with some counterfeit
Whole damn hundred
Must of been desperate
Be out here bein' greedy, so the line I didn't check it
So I'm sittin' in the spot
Countin' on my knot
Pistol on the flo' while I'm sittin' on the couch
Then I heard a knock
I know this bet' not
I was so damn excited I forgot to grab the Glock
Snatched open the do'
Gave my dawg the nod
And pieced his ass up while he was reachin' for that do' nob
Grabbed his head and kneed him in his chin
Put 'em in a headlock, kicked him in the shin
Got him on the ground
Hands on the throat
But guess what the fuck this nigga started reachin' fo'?
Lucky for me my nigga peeped him, changed the moment
Cause at that very point, shit went in slow motion
Picked up the heater
Cocked that bitch back
Squeezed two times saw a real bright flash
"Tat tat"
Then the fiend started screamin'
Ran out the apartment with his right calf leakin'
Then we chase after
Heater still smokin'
Caught him in the alley and let that bitch open
"Tat tat"
He squeezed two mo' at my man
And next thing we heard he gettin' picked up in an ambulance
Next day
Chillin' feelin' proper
We just smokin' some Mustafah
Hash in it, and we ain't even mention it
Around this time playin' 2K1
We were so young and dumb dawg we even kept the gun
And if we got caught dawg we would've got hung

###"I'm Out"###

I had to be like 15
My dawg ain't have his ills but copped a Cutlass Supreme
Clean from an old white dude, he got a deal
And at the gas station where he got killed
Late night filling up
Niggas shot him up
Asleep when the call came, news when I woke up
17, carjacked, dead at the Mobil
I swear I shed a tear every time I see a photo
Now I'm all grown up same spot [?]
Old school Chevy check the rear view mirror
Give a bum a buck, show the hood niggas love
Pocket full of kush so I hit them with a nug
My homie left the hood, I ain't seen him in a minute
Pull up smoking reggie with his bitch in a rental
He said "I just got out" and can I let him hold something
I told him that I'm broke, man I ain't got nothing

[Hook]
And I'm out (aight then)
In a '87 Cutty about to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (aight then)
Blowing on some kush the color Minnesota Viking
And I'm out (aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night end
And I'm out (aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning [?]

See this is all we know
Just running round the hood dawg with nowhere to go
Wanna grab some swishers but the narcs at the store
So we parked at my man's, put the chronic on hold
So now we just posting, drinking on some 40s
My nigga got his 40 said drop him at his shorty's
Told my nigga chill, about to roll one with hash
Soon as the hook leave then my nigga we can smash
All in rotation, puff puff passin'
Eyes like cherries through magnifying glasses
Think I got the munchies, my nigga, you hungry?
Bout to ride to courttown grab us some munchies
The blunt turned to ash, gave a [?] and laughed
Drunk the rest of the 40, threw the bottle in the trash
Made sure I had my phone, grabbed a square out the pack
Gave my homie that, jumped in the Cutty and I smashed

And I'm out (aight then)
In a '87 Cutty about to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (aight then)
Blowing on some kush [?]
And I'm out (aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night ends
And I'm out (aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning [?]

###"Fields"###

[Verse 1:]
When money talk only broke people listen
Ain't gotta pot to piss in can't afford to pay attention
These unfamiliar niggas be expecting recognition
Respect the intellect let me continue on the mission
Use to walk through alleys paths in the field
You know that one house where Kenneth use to live
Now it's just another shortcut to the store
The tv and my window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps told me buy wonder bread
On the way these niggas jumped left me with knot on my head
Went to school yesterday but to had leave early
Cause niggas said they was gone jump me at 3: 30
All because I lived in the hood who they had beef with
And I ain't tell em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
But I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Nigga played me now that nigga ain't around to tell the story
Just young nigga on the D.O.T
With my headphones on and sack full of weed
Rhymes in my head thought nobody wanted to hear em
So I had the fiends hitting rocks like the Pilgrims

[Hook: x2]
And where I live it's house, field, field
Field field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

[Verse 2:]
That nigga much sicker
That's why he pop them pills, sip lean, smoke swishers
Yea I'm doing drugs thought I never ever try
That had eyes so dry dog I wish I could cry
I'm fucking bad foreign bitches why you niggas in the hood
Smoking on some dirt weed smelling like fire wood
Sitting on porches of abandoned houses
Or sitting in the field on bed bug ridden couches
It's like they all forgot man nobody care about us
That why we all ways end up in prison instead of college
Living in the system working kitchen for chump change
Lost in the streets niggas playing that gun game
Where nobody wins just a bunch of mommas losing
Dead bodys in the field and nobody heard the shooting
We living in the streets where the options is limited
Cause it's burnt building instead of jobs and buisseness

[Hook]

###"The Hybrid"###

[Verse 1:]
I'm the first to breakfast, late for dinner
Flow so hot I'm sorta like incine-rator
Hater none greater than the urban dictator
Spit like New Jack City wedding caterer
Brown like the Prince of Arabia
The Last Dragon your Eddie Arkadian
I'm negotiating like Chris Sabian
You on some gay shit like Les Nubians
I'm in the new B.M. playing Brand Nubian
What I am is a new being
Not a martian nor human I'm hybrid
Open ya eyelids
You might miss something like a
Phenomenon
Far from a honest john
Used to slang for weeks without Degree under my underarms
I can go on and on
Rocks in my long johns
You were wearing cummerbunds on yo way to prom
I was chopping like lumberjacks
Clutch ya girls pom poms
Nigga you a puss puss
I beat you like a tom tom
Mush you for kush
And blow it with ya baby moms
And I ain't got to tell you cause you know just where I come from

(Who is this kid, some sort of cyborg?)
I'm a Hybrid
SOLAR BARS!

[Verse 2:]
I'm the first to breakfast late for dinner
Flow so cold I'm sorta like polar
Solar system planet Neptune
Black like car fumes
Colors like cartoons
They say Danny Brown "boy you a fool"
"Where you get them shoes"
Look nigga don't remember
Shop so much everyday like December
Wrapping up the chronic while I open up a 5th
My bitch a bad girl she don't get no gifts
She just get froze
She just get snow
She just get my dick hard under mistletoe
I know it's fucked up that's ya little sister bro
She gotta fat ass that's just how this shit go
Watching Anchorman she go down slow
Oh Oh
I'm bout to cum
Now runteldat like Martin Lawrence stand up
No this ain't a robbery but nigga get yo hands up
Like yo granny at church when the preacher said stand up
She said, "Oh lord
Please help my grandson get up out the basement and find his self a job"
"Find a nice girl so he can quit jacking off
"And leaving white stains allover my new towels"
Ow Ow Ow

I'm a hybrid
SOLAR BARS!

###"Blunt After Blunt"###

[Verse 1]
Kush got a nigga feeling awesome
Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin
Told her bend over, hit that shit doggy
Called her a cab then I told that bitch to call me
Danny Brown bitch, tell me what you need
I got some Adderall and fire ass weed
And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so bitch I woulda been died
But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche?
Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased
Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans cause I'm taking all they hoes
Hold up, wait a minute
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Zanny nodding off watching menace
Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimmace
Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

[Hook]
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

[Verse 2]
'til my brain feels ten pounds heavier
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven if she even gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties
We 'bout to make a movie, starring me and a cast full of groupies
And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt

[Hook]

###"The Return"###

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
See they think I'm a fuck nigga
But if they ever see me then they might have to duck, nigga
Like what, nigga? Before your ass can answer, get your whole shit bust, nigga
Them rolls off them ashes, drinking Fiji water
Wanna pull me in that fire when I'm trynna feed my daughter
Wanna snatch my mommas plate, and tell her she can't eat
And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this grief
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmama, strip a man of all his honor
Out here tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with the tounges for the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain I pray mercy

[Hook: Danny Brown]
The return of the gangsta cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street
The return of the gangster cause niggas got deals
This rap shit don't work then it's back to selling krills
Return of the gangster cause niggas want that real
Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill
Return of the gangster fucked that hipster squeeze the trigger
You got me fucked up I'm a hood ass nigga

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ash tray
Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Dropped it in the chronic finna lock it that's some bad yay
Tryna save my soul I wish the lord would meet me half way
Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And them motor minnesota
Only option is a shoot out if the police pull me over
This shit get real as shit that's on your Playstation controller
Call of Duty ass nigga
Dick in the booty ass nigga
Don't po' up
